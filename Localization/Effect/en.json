  "burning.glossary": "🔥 Burning - imposes a torch/bow/flamethrower/Molotov cocktail/grenade launcher.\nEach unit of burning deals 1 damage. When the player has two or more units of burning, he/she loses 1 energy for each subsequent unit (the formula for energy loss: X-1, where X is the unit, the strength of burning).\n\nBy default, the player burns for 2 turns, and extinguishes himself on the third fire (the gas mask burns for 1 turn).\nIf you set the target on fire again on the third turn (if it has not been extinguished), the burn counter will be updated and the burning itself will intensify.\n\nYou can extinguish yourself by pressing the skip turn/extinguish button.\nAlso, you can extinguish yourself in the turn when the burning status is only imposed - if you click the skip turn button.\n\nExamples:\n\nExample of extinguishing right away\n☄️|Rat 1|🐭 sets fire to the arrow and shoots it at Alex!🔥 |Alex is on fire!\n💨| Alex extinguishes himself.

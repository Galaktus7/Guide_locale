fear.glossary: '👁⚫️⚫️👁 Fear - imposes the energy of darkness, Shadow of the Rat, Amalgam,
  Darkness. Fear "breaks" the buttons, replacing them with "escape" if the fear counter
  is 2 or more. If the player accidentally presses it, he dies without the possibility
  of being saved by a zombie or the Inquisitor. The same applies if the fear counter
  reaches 5.

burning.glossary: '🔥 Burning - imposes a torch/bow/flamethrower/Molotov cocktail/grenade
  launcher.

  Each unit of burning deals 1 damage. When the player has two or more units of burning,
  he/she loses 1 energy for each subsequent unit (the formula for energy loss: X-1,
  where X is the unit, the strength of burning).


  By default, the player burns for 2 turns, and extinguishes himself on the third
  fire (the gas mask burns for 1 turn).

  If you set the target on fire again on the third turn (if it has not been extinguished),
  the burn counter will be updated and the burning itself will intensify.


  You can extinguish yourself by pressing the skip turn/extinguish button.

  Also, you can extinguish yourself in the turn when the burning status is only imposed
  - if you click the skip turn button.


  Examples:


  Example of extinguishing right away

  ☄️|Rat 1|🐭 sets fire to the arrow and shoots it at Alex!🔥 |Alex is on fire!

  💨| Alex extinguishes himself. (I clicked on the skip turn button)

  🔥| The fire on Alex is extinguished!


  Example of the fire duration

  Move: 1

  ☄️| Alex fires the arrow and shoots it at Rat 1 |🐭!🔥|Rat 1|🐭 caught fire!

  🔥|Rat 1|🐭 is burning! It loses 1 energy and receives 2 damage.

  Move: 3

  🔥|Fire at Rat 1| is🐭 extinguished!'

  counter for 3 turns (Dual-Life - this counter increases). After 3 turns, life is
  removed (you cannot block life removal with a shield or roll). If you cause a player
  with bleeding to bleed - it will increase, namely the counter minus 1.


  Example:

crippled.glossary: '🤕 Crippled - imposes an ax. Crippled reduces the player''s damage
  threshold, which makes it easier to take down 2+ lives in one attack. By default,
  the damage threshold is 6 (a strong skull increases it).


  Example:


  👊| Alex hits Rat 1 |🐭 with an ax! 2 damage dealt!


  🤕| Rat 1 | is🐭 crippled! (1)


  The rat now has a damage threshold of 6-1 = 5, if I deal 5 or more damage to it,

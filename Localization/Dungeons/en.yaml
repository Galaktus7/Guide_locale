  \nBasic rhino attack pattern (without rage):\nDash > attack > attack > rest\nBasic\
  \ rhino attack pattern (with rage)\nDash > attack > attack > attack > rest\n\nWalkthrough\
  \ tips (solo):\nLet's start with weapons, there are weapons that will be effective\
  \ against the rhino, and there are weapons that will be little or no effective at\
  \ all, and neutral\n\n✅ Effective: knife, sawblade, saber, pole, brass knuckles,\
  \ police baton, steel claws, cleaver.\n❌Few and ineffective: axe, flamethrower,\
  \ bow, sniper rifle, shotgun, sawed-off shotgun, chain, mace.  \nNeutral:\nEverything\
  \ else\n\nRecommended abilities:\nNinja, strong skull, biceps, concentration, inquisitor,\
  \ medic, biped, shield generator, alchemist, armourer (depending on weapon)\n\n\
  The walkthrough itself:\nRhino Actions:\n(⚠️ please note, I do not take into account\
  \ police baton, brass knuckles, light grenade, knocking down, parrying, and more)\n\
  Dash > attack > attack > rest\nMove 1: Dash \nMove 2: Attack \nMove 3: Attack \n\
  Move 4: Rest \n\n▫️ Move 1: I suggest rolling; even if you have a light grenade,\
  \ I recommend holding it until the rhino rage; the same goes for parrying a saber,\
  \ if you parry, chances are you'll still get stunned and lose a move.\nIf you have\
  \ an alchemist, you can roll and use rabies serum on yourself.\n\nNow the rhino\
  \ will act like this:\nattack > attack > rest\nMove 2: Attack \nMove 3: Attack \n\
  Move 4: Rest \n\n▫️ Move 2. Attack/shield/inquisitor pray for rhino/throw throwing\
  \ knife\n▫️ Move 3. Recharge/attack (depends on the amount of current energy, since\
  \ the rhino will be resting, you should hit it on turn 4)\n▫️ move 4. Attack\n\n\
  Now the rhino will act like this:\nDash > attack > attack > attack > rest\nMove\
  \ 5: Roll \nMove 6: Attack \nMove 7: Attack \nMove 8: Rest \n\n▫️ Move 5. Since\
  \ the roll is on cooldown, it is recommended to use shield, chitin, saber parry\
  \ if none of these are available...\U0001FAE1\n▫️ move 6. Roll\n▫️ move 7. Recharge/attack\
  \ (depends on the amount of current energy, since the rhino will be resting, you\
  \ should hit it on turn 8)\n▫️ turn 8. Attack\n\nIf you're lucky, the rhino should\
  \ be on a rampage by now\nSo, its pattern is now:\nDash > attack > attack > attack\
  \ > rest\nMove 9: Dash \nMove 10: Attack \nMove 11: Attack \nMove 12: Attack\nMove\
  \ 13: Rest \n\n▫️ move 9. If you have - light grenade, if not - roll, shield, chitin,\
  \ sabre parry.... If none of these are available...\U0001FAE1\n▫️ move 10. Attack\n\
  ▫️ move 11. Attack\n\nIf you're lucky, you've already won.... (or 100 times dead)"

  \ the rhino must be stunned (chitin on the rhino, prayer of the inquisitor on the\
  \ rhino), wait until the stun should work. The first player throws darkness a turn\

  Opponents: Alastor


  {Alastor_characteristics}


  ▫️Necromancer''s staff, jerk, darkness - they are mandatory, without them you will
  either pass or fail (in solo at least)

  That leaves us with one ‘free’ ability, I recommend it:

  ✅Recommended abilities: alchemist, armourer, shield generator, inquisitor.


  Walkthrough tips (solo):

  ▫️ Use the alchemist (if available) and darkness on yourself (and pray very hard
  that it doesn''t take the form of 2️⃣ while the darkness is in cd)

  The point is that thanks to the darkness, your attacks will get +1 damage, and abilities
  that have a cooldown will be accelerated (including roll and dash).


  Now you just have to slowly kill Alastor by countering his vanshots correctly.


  ⚠️ Try not to summon the Necromancer''s staff ‘dead man''s rise’ before his attack,
  firstly, the darkness does not affect the recharge, secondly, the Electric Beam
  deals damage like a grenade (i.e. attacking all targets), this also applies to corpses,
  including corpses from the Necromancer''s staff.

  ⚠️Во time of dead man''s summoning, if possible, try to have 0 energy. Alastor with
  an electric beam and hypnosis can break through the shield of the necromancer''s
  staff!


  ⚠️После the first pass of the dungeon, rolls, normal shields, inquisitor will save
  you from ‘vanshot attacks’


  🔺After the first pass (i.e. no more vanshots):

  1️⃣🦏 Rhino

  ▫️ Rhino attacks, dealing 15 damage.

  2️⃣♨️ Shiver of the Earth

  ▫️ Attack deals 3-6 damage + inflicts bleed.

  3️⃣❗️ Scourge

  ▫️ Attack deals 1-4 damage.'
